When interacting with the operating systems I always use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html][Eshell]]
because it integrates seamlessly with Emacs, supports (remote) [[https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/][TRAMP]]
file names and also works nice on Windows.

After starting shell commands (like long running build jobs) I often lose track the task when switching buffers.

Thanks to Emacs [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Hooks.html][hooks]] mechanism you can customize Emacs to call a
elisp function when an external command finishes.

I use [[https://github.com/jwiegley][John Wiegleys]] excellent [[https://github.com/jwiegley/alert][alert]] package to send
desktop notifications:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'alert)

(defun eshell-command-alert (process status)
  "Send `alert' with severity based on STATUS when PROCESS finished."
  (let* ((cmd (process-command process))
	   (buffer (process-buffer process))
	   (msg (format "%s: %s" (mapconcat 'identity cmd " ")  status)))
    (if (string-prefix-p "finished" status)
	  (alert msg :buffer buffer :severity  'normal)
	(alert msg :buffer buffer :severity 'urgent))))

(add-hook 'eshell-kill-hook #'eshell-command-alert)
#+END_SRC

[[https://github.com/jwiegley/alert][alert]] rules can be setup programmatically. In my case I only want to get 
notified if the corresponding buffer is not visible:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(alert-add-rule :status   '(buried)     ;only send alert when buffer not visible
		  :mode     'eshell-mode
		  :style 'notifications)
#+END_SRC

This even works on [[https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/][TRAMP]]
buffers.  Below is a screenshot showing a Gnome desktop notification
of a failed =make= command.
